&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-my-ankle-inflammation-sucks:e1fcc30f006df7a2160b310feaecd78b&#34;&gt;Why My Ankle Inflammation Sucks?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucks for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;loosing-fittness:e1fcc30f006df7a2160b310feaecd78b&#34;&gt;Loosing Fittness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every bike rider, the season starts around October. We start the preparation period around early or mid October. I thought I was going to race this year, so I started a very strict training plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.wooh.hu/images/ankle/strava.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fittness Dropping&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; training would started from 14th of February. Well I had no chance. As you can see on the graph, my fittness is going sharply down. Although my form is pretty good, but currently I&amp;rsquo;m at the same level as I was in November. No good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-t-let-out-some-steam:e1fcc30f006df7a2160b310feaecd78b&#34;&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t Let Out Some Steam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, riding is indispensable. I&amp;rsquo;m working from home, and I rarely go outside. There is no daily contact with anyone. I need to ride 1-3 hours a day to let out the steam, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated and unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just you, your bike and the nature. I try to ride on roads with no traffic at all. I really miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-t-play-with-my-son:e1fcc30f006df7a2160b310feaecd78b&#34;&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t Play With My Son&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son is 17 months old and loves to move around the house. Fortunately he&amp;rsquo;s pretty adaptive and he&amp;rsquo;s playing next to me on the couch, but this is not what he deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.wooh.hu/images/ankle/bogyi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bogyi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-what-s-happening-now:e1fcc30f006df7a2160b310feaecd78b&#34;&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s Happening Now?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month has passed away and I finally I could see light at the end of the tunnel. I went to see a doctor on Saturday, so he finally did some X-Rays and told me that there is nothing serious. He prescribed another NSAID. I have to put a little more weight on it every day and do some excercises while taking the NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope for the bests.&lt;/p&gt;
