### Reduced NSAID doseage

The doctor changed the NSAID doses on saturday. He prescribed a new NSAID called Xilox (Nimesulide). So since Saturday I had to take:

- **Ibuprofen**: 300mg x 2 (morning, evening)
- **Nimesulide**: 50mg x 2 (morning, evening)

But it seems it's now enough to take:

- **Ibuprofen**: 300mg x 1 (evening)
- **Nimesulide**: 50mg x 2 (morning, evening)

Taking NSAIDs have a tradeoff: No pain, no inflammation. But long-term, high-dose NSAID use to a greater risk for heart attack, stroke, heart failure and death from cardiovascular disease.

### Daily excercise

Every morning after I wake up, I do a few excercises to warm up my ankle. For example I have to push a ball to the wall. So entertaining..

I put on my shoes and walk small distances with only 1 crutch. Frist I stared with 2 cruches but I can put more weight on it, so one is enough. I still can't put 100% weight on it, still need a few more days.

### No more pain

I haven't experienced pain in the last ~4 days, even with reduced amount of NSAID. It's pretty good. The ankle isn't hot, no more swelling.

### Ride! Getting ready

I'm really excited to get on my bike again, but I have to be patient. I know that in about 2 weeks I'll be able to ride again, of course I won't be able to continue my training plan. I think during the rest of the season I'll mostly do `E2` aka. Endurance-Miles rides only. That means just do as much long rides as I can, in my Heart Rate zone 2. That will prevent my ankle from any overload/overtrain.

### Compared to 2013 it was pretty quick

I had the same issue in 2013 when I was in the US. After flying to San Francisco, I experienced a huge pain in my ankle after the very first day. That year it took about 5-6 months to recover. I tried every treatment without any luck. I was very frustrated and had no idea what was going on. Luckily just before I had to fly again to US (Seattle) it suddenly improved, so I could accept an offer.
