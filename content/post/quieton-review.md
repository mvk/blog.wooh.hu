I finally got my hand on the QuietOn active noise cancelling earplugs, what I ordered back in 2016 March. Does it worth it for $160? Are you looking for full silence? Do you have misophonia or just want to sleep when your significant other is snorring. Let's see if this gadget helps you or not.

I love gadgets. I often buy things than I don't need. Although a headphone or an earplug is different. Everyone uses them. I'm a bit [misophonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia) so sometimes I need to be in a quiet place. Luckily I'm working from home, but what if I have to work from a coffee shop?

Things to consider before buying any noise cancelling headphones/earplugs:

- **Size**. Is it heavy or too big to carry around? Or maybe very fragile and won't easily fit into your packet.

- **Price**. If it's pricey you will likely to protect it rather using it, just like I did with my JBL J88i.

- **Comfort**. Is it convenient to wear? For a headphone or earplug it's mandatory to be comfortable to wear.

- **Performance**. Is it really cancelling all kind of noise or just specific high or low frequency noises.

- **Battery life**. How long does your headphone/earplug last with one charge.

- **Charging time**. How long does it take to charge your device. 

- **Wired or Wireless**. Do you have to deal with the wires or you can just stand up and do whatever you want.

Originally the QuietOn project was launched on [indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/quieton-active-noise-cancelling-earplugs-sleep) on the 2016 January. At that time they already had a prototype and estabilished the company. What's more, they had already started the usability tests.

I see their promo video in March and decided to support the project, so I ordered a pair of QuietOn for **$130 USD**.

The video suggests that it filters out any frequency noise including:

- office noises
- car horns
- hotel room noises
- etc


Although the reality is way to far from this, but let's starts with the size.

### Size

It is quite a small gadget if we take into account that it can do active noise cancellation and passive noise reduction. A pair of earplug weights around **3.8g** and fits easily into any small packet. QuietOn recommends to carry them in their charging box. With the box it's **25g**. An extra pair of tips can be easily fitted into the box too.

The carry/charger box itself is made of plastic. You don't want to drop it, because it might break. I wouldn't say this is the best quality product ever I've seen but probably last for a few years falling into pieces.
